| The Six Fingers of Time | R.A. Lafferty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|

I'll get this out of the way early; this is barely a book.
This is a 22 page short story. The key is to understand that I don't care, this is just a reflection on my reading.

**The Plot**

A young businessman — Charles Vincent — wakes up (on a weekday) to find that the world has changed in a very obtuse way. The hands of his clock
have seemingly stopped, the water from his faucet comes out like jelly at a snails pace, and almost everything he touches breaks
on impact.

Upon further inspection and experimentation, he finds that the second hand of the clock moves once every minute or so, and he could move
carefully to avoid breaking things. He goes through his morning rigamaroll and goes out to find people are seemingly dead (again, time
was moving slowly enough that this seemed to be the case for him). 

He nearly killed a man driving when we opened his car door and stomped on the brakes. 

He proceeded to steal food from cafeteria, but justified it due to his inability to cook, his belief that the people were dead, and an
inability to pay.

He found this slowness to be highly useful at work — he caught up on days of missed work, and got ahead on field reports. He didn't find himself hungry or tired after (what he
percieved to be) hours of work.

Mr. Vincent fell asleep at his desk, and woke up to time proceeding as normal. He believed the prior experience to be a dream, yet his work
was actually completed, and on his desk. 

He had no close friends, so decided to go to his doctor, Dr. Mason — a close aquaintance — to discuss the dream he had faced on that morning. He recounted 
his morning experience to the doctor. 

The doctor suggested he might've been in a dream state and sleepwalked through his work. Vincent was quick to accept this explanation, but the doctor had
his own reservations.
