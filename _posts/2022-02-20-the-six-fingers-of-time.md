| The Six Fingers of Time | R.A. Lafferty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|

I'll get this out of the way early; this is barely a book.
This is a 22 page short story. The key is to understand that I don't care, this is just a reflection on my reading.

## The Plot 
**Spoilers, obvoiusly. Skip to the next bold header for my thoughts on the book**

A young businessman — Charles Vincent — wakes up (on a weekday) to find that the world has changed in a very obtuse way. The hands of his clock
have seemingly stopped, the water from his faucet comes out like jelly at a snails pace, and almost everything he touches breaks
on impact.

Upon further inspection and experimentation, he finds that the second hand of the clock moves once every minute or so, and he could move
carefully to avoid breaking things. He goes through his morning rigamaroll and goes out to find people are seemingly dead (again, time
was moving slowly enough that this seemed to be the case for him). 

He nearly killed a man driving when we opened his car door and stomped on the brakes. 

He proceeded to steal food from cafeteria, but justified it due to his inability to cook, his belief that the people were dead, and an
inability to pay.

He found this slowness to be highly useful at work — he caught up on days of missed work, and got ahead on field reports. He didn't find himself hungry or tired after (what he
percieved to be) hours of work.

Mr. Vincent fell asleep at his desk, and woke up to time proceeding as normal. He believed the prior experience to be a dream, yet his work
was actually completed, and on his desk. 

He had no close friends, so decided to go to his doctor, Dr. Mason — a close aquaintance — to discuss the dream he had faced on that morning. He recounted 
his morning experience to the doctor. 

The doctor suggested he might've been in a dream state and sleepwalked through his work. Vincent was quick to accept this explanation, but the doctor was
unsatisfied. 

He recounted having a patient in on that morning — face smashed in during car ride, saw ghostly apparation — that corroborated Vincent's story, and
told of a very similar experience 2 earlier patients of his had. Both of those patients died within a year, and died of old age.

Vincent wrote off these concerns — he was too young to die from senility. 

Later, in a strangley empty club, a faceless man started conversation. He encouraged him to read a book on the relationship between 'extradigitism' (having extra
fingers) and genius. Vincent had a misshaped thumb he hid, but it was not a 6th finger, nor was he a genius. 

Vincent wanted out with this guy, and tried to shoo him away, to no avail. The strange man filled Vincent's glass in an instant and told him to recall his
experience from days earlier — he had the power to watch while Vincent was in 'the aspect'.

The man taught him to get back into his elevated state by envisioning himself in or out of the state.

Vincent began to use this ability to his advantage, playing pranks on people, making quick money, et cetera. 

People around him began to comment on his appearance; they claimed he looked older, but he did not care. 

He began to learn at an accelerated pace: 120-200 books/night, learning every language sequentially, and discovering a main thread of history. 

He felt 'the pit,' and it's looming 6 digit hand. He saw it in his dreams. He noticed it in major historical events. He was caught in it's web.

He read the book on extradigitism, and found that persons of genius tended to have an oddity; they had excess toes, fingers, or vestiges upon them. 

The book theorised that those with 6 fingers were in the same time (60%5 & 60%6 are 0), but inhabited different planes. 

Vincent was now a recluse, no longer interested in the benign and slow ways of 'normal' life. 

In a dark club, he was again approached by the faceless man. He said that unless Vincent were to make progress, he would be useless to the 'ancient race.'
Vincent also now knew of more than 2 planes of time, and he was loosley a descendant of the 'ancient race,' as he was only vestigal.

The man claimed that Vincent would destroy himself unless he took the 'second step,' those who take only the first step die. Vincent would be given the 
opportunity to take the second step in due time. 

Yet the faceless man smelled wrong; he smelled of the pit and it's hand. 

Vincent no longer induldged in pranks, and he was now interested in a woman 15 years his elder, as opposed to Jenny (his age).

The ghosts of the pit persecuted him, yet he would not answer to them. They eventually came to him to give the ultimatum; he may either join the members of
the pit and live for a time that approximates eternity, or pay the price for the use of his powers in some other way. He chose the latter. To compensate for
this choice, he would now use his powers to their fullest. 

Dr. Mason was worried by Vincents vast medical knowledge, and his deteriorating health. And news reports claimed the young ghost had been replaced by an old
one. 

Vincent became entranced by a woman 30 years his elder, then interested (no longer enamored or in love) in another 50 years his elder. 

[The rest of this summary is the ending to the story, way better than I could retell on my own]

When enough knowledge is accumulated on any subject, the pattern will sometimes emerge suddenly, like a form in a picture revealed where before it was not seen. And when enough knowledge is accumulated on all subjects, is there not a chance that a pattern governing all subjects will emerge?

Charles Vincent was caught up in one last enthusiasm. On a long vigil, as he consulted source after source and sorted them in his mind, it seemed that the pattern was coming out clearly and simply, for all its amazing complexity of detail.

“I know everything that they know in the pit, and I know a secret that they do not know. I have not lost the race—I have won it. I can defeat them at the point where they believe themselves invulnerable. If controlled hereafter, we need at least not be controlled by them. It is all falling together now. I have found the final truth, and it is they who have lost the race. I hold the key. I will now be able to enjoy the advantage without paying the ultimate price of defeat and destruction, or of collaboration with them.

“Now I have only to implement my knowledge, to publish the fact, and one shadow at least will be lifted from mankind. I will do it at once. Well, nearly at once. It is almost dawn in the normal world. I will sit here a very little while and rest. Then I will go out and begin to make contact with the proper persons for the disposition of this thing. But first I will sit here a little while and rest."

And he died quietly in his chair as he sat there.

DR. MASON made an entry in his private journal: “Charles Vincent, a completely authenticated case of premature aging, one of the most clear-cut in all gerontology. This man was known to me for years, and I here aver that as of one year ago he was of normal appearance and physical state, and that his chronology is also correct, I having also known his father. I examined the subject during the period of his illness, and there is no question at all of his identity, which has also been established for the record by fingerprinting and other means. I aver that Charles Vincent at the age of thirty is dead of old age, having the appearance and organic condition of a man of ninety.”

Then the doctor began to make another note: “As in two other cases of my own observation, the illness was accompanied by a certain delusion and series of dreams, so nearly identical in the three men as to be almost unbelievable. And for the record, and no doubt to the prejudice of my own reputation, I will set down the report of them here.”

But when Dr. Mason had written that, he thought about it for a while.

“No, I will do no such thing,” he said, and he struck out the last lines he had written. “It is best to let sleeping dragons lie.”

And somewhere the faceless men with the smell of the pit on them smiled to themselves in quiet irony.

## My Thoughts

The jist of the story, from what I gather, is that
